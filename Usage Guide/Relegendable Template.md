# Relegendable Template

If you happen to purchase the same relegendable keycaps as listed in the [Parts List](https://fearherbs1.github.io/blue-team-pad-docs/ordering-guide/#parts-list), you can use the following template to create your own paper labels to print out and put on the keycaps.

## Templates

* [PNG](https://github.com/fearherbs1/blue-team-pad/blob/main/Relegendable%20Template/BTP%20relegendable%20Template%20V1.png)

* [PhotoShop PSD](https://github.com/fearherbs1/blue-team-pad/blob/main/Relegendable%20Template/BTP%20relegendable%20Template%20V1.psd)

If you do not have access to PhotoShop, [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) is a free great online alternative that can work with PSDs.

After creating your labels, be sure to print on `8.5x11` paper for correct sizing.

## Example

Here is an example of what the labels look like on the keycaps.
