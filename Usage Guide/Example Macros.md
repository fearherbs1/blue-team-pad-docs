# Example Macros

The following macros are included here as an example of what is possible with this device:

<span class="fs-5">
[Productivity](/blue-team-pad-docs/usage-guide/example-macros/productivity/){: .btn .btn-blue }   [Windows Triage](/blue-team-pad-docs/usage-guide/example-macros/windows-triage/){: .btn .btn-blue }   [Mac Triage](/blue-team-pad-docs/usage-guide/example-macros/mac-triage/){: .btn .btn-blue }   [Linux Triage](/blue-team-pad-docs/usage-guide/example-macros/linux-triage/){: .btn .btn-blue}
</span>

If you would like to load these separately to another vial device, you can use the "Open Text Editor" feature within vial to load these macros on it.
